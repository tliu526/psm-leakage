Discussion from authors on review measures:

> No clear pattern emerges: neither intervention type nor outcome characteristics were strongly associated with the degree of agreement between designs for any of the measures we considered (direction of effect, magnitude, or statistical significance). Inspection of Table â€‹Table22 suggests that, if anything, the degree of agreement was more strongly associated with the source review than the intervention or outcome characteristics

> We conjecture that the results we reviewed place a lower bound on the degree of agreement
